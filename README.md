# BakeGenie — AI-powered Precision Baking Web App

BakeGenie is a web-based application that brings professional-grade precision into home baking. It combines computer vision, AI-based ingredient conversion, and recipe recommendation systems to help users measure ingredients accurately and explore new recipes based on their available ingredients.

Built with a minimalistic and clean UI, BakeGenie is designed for efficiency, accuracy, and an enjoyable baking experience.

## 📌 Features

- **📸 AI Ingredient Measurement**

  - Real-time container detection (cups, bowls, spoons) using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model.
  - (WIP) Fill-level estimation using Mask R-CNN to predict the amount inside the container.
  - Converts detected volume to gram measurements based on a dynamic ingredient density database.

- **🧮 Ingredient Conversion (Manual Input)**

  - Users manually select container size and ingredient type to get accurate gram equivalents.
  - Supports conversion for a wide variety of ingredients like flour, sugar, butter, milk, etc.

- **🤖 Smart Recipe Recommendations**
  - Users input available ingredients.
  - Gemini API-powered chatbot suggests personalized recipes.
- **📚 Recipe Database Integration**

  - Backend-ready integration of a processed Kaggle dataset with 200K+ recipes. (working on migrating from sample data to full Kaggle dataset)
  - Search and display of detailed recipes, ingredients, and steps (currently sample database active).

- **🛠️ Recipe Adjustment (Future)**

  - Automatically scale recipe quantities based on available ingredient amounts.

- **🎵 Productivity Enhancements (Planned)**
  - Optional ambient sounds for a focused, fun baking environment.
