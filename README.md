# BakeGenie ‚Äî AI-powered Precision Baking Web App

BakeGenie is a web-based application that brings professional-grade precision into home baking. It combines computer vision, AI-based ingredient conversion, and recipe recommendation systems to help users measure ingredients accurately and explore new recipes based on their available ingredients.

Built with a minimalistic and clean UI, BakeGenie is designed for efficiency, accuracy, and an enjoyable baking experience.

## üìå Features

- **üì∏ AI Ingredient Measurement**

  - Real-time container detection (cups, bowls, spoons) using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model.
  - (WIP) Fill-level estimation using Mask R-CNN to predict the amount inside the container.
  - Converts detected volume to gram measurements based on a dynamic ingredient density database.

- **üßÆ Ingredient Conversion (Manual Input)**

  - Users manually select container size and ingredient type to get accurate gram equivalents.
  - Supports conversion for a wide variety of ingredients like flour, sugar, butter, milk, etc.

- **ü§ñ Smart Recipe Recommendations**
  - Users input available ingredients.
  - Gemini API-powered chatbot suggests personalized recipes.
- **üìö Recipe Database Integration**

  - Backend-ready integration of a processed Kaggle dataset with 200K+ recipes. (working on migrating from sample data to full Kaggle dataset)
  - Search and display of detailed recipes, ingredients, and steps (currently sample database active).

- **üõ†Ô∏è Recipe Adjustment (Future)**

  - Automatically scale recipe quantities based on available ingredient amounts.

- **üéµ Productivity Enhancements (Planned)**
  - Optional ambient sounds for a focused, fun baking environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

> Prerequisites: Python 3.10, Node.js (for frontend local server), pip

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/surajsinghshekhawat/BakeGenie
   cd bakegenie
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Model File Setup**

   The application uses a custom-trained model for ingredient measurement. You have two options to set it up:

   **Option 1: Automatic Download (Recommended)**

   - The app will automatically download the model file when you first run it
   - No manual steps required

   **Option 2: Manual Download**

   - Download the model file directly from: [Model Download Link](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1VaB9qmln89nWr74fhceatvvaTqUQMgqU)
   - Create a `models` folder in the project root if it doesn't exist
   - Place the downloaded `checkpoint.pth` file in the `models` folder

4. **Run backend server**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Run frontend**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

6. **Access the app**
   - Open browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:3000`
